      <p class="card-text">Nothing beats a long walk with your four-legged friend on a fresh, spring morning. Or seeing the joy on their faces when you pick up a ball and they know it’s playtime in the local park! Even relaxing at home feels better in each other’s company.

There’s an old saying, which is certainly true, that pets and dogs repay the love you give them ten-fold.

Before you rush out and get a dog, it’s important to think it through very thoroughly. It can be hard work and it’s a lifetime commitment, as your dog will be relying on you for many years to come.

Once you’re sure you have the time and lifestyle to include a dog in your life, and you’ve done your research about different breeds and personalities it’s time to look at all the benefits of owning a dog.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Like humans, dogs can also develop some forms of cancer. Much like us, dogs can get brain tumors to similarly destructive effect, so learning which genes predispose our canine companions to gliomas may also be translated into cancer research for human patients.

Moreover, a contagious form of canine cancer could shed light into how forms of cancer found in humans have come to develop.

Dogs can also experience certain features characteristic of dementia, such as impaired problem-solving abilities.

Researchers explain that by understanding how cognitive tasks are affected in these quadrupeds, we may become better equipped to solve the riddle of dementia in the case of humans, too.

      <p class="card-text">"Dogs," notes Dr. Rosalind Arden, of the London School of Economics and Political Science in the U.K., "are one of the few animals that reproduce many of the key features of dementia."

"[S]o," she goes on to add, "understanding their cognitive abilities could be valuable in helping us to understand the causes of this disorder in humans and possibly test treatments for it."

Dogs are not just incredibly loveable and often very funny friends whose antics fuel the Internet's store of memes continuously; their company also keeps us in good physical shape. Also, their health problems — sadly but endearingly — often mirror our own.

Most of all, however, we welcome them into our lives — and have done so since time immemorial — because they instantly bring us the sort of joy and calm that we would otherwise have to work hard to obtain.</p>
